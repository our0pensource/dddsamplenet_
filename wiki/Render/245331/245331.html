<h2>Aggregates</h2>
The following image shows that in CQRS - Event Sourcing variant there is only one (compared to there in vanilla version) aggregate present: the Cargo aggregate.<br /><img src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=dddsamplenet&DownloadId=109994" alt="Domain.png" title="Domain.png" /><br /><br />In addition to standard elements, in Event Sourcing version, <b>Cargo</b> aggregate contains a new kind of objects: events representing explicit state transitions of the aggregate. After executing domain logic, the event representing corresponding state change is instantiated and <i>published</i> to both internal event store and external systems. The latter mechanism is used to transport state change notifications to the query side of the system.<br /><br />There is only one entity present in the system: <span class="codeInline">Cargo</span>.<br /><a name="Reporting"></a>
<h2>Reporting model</h2>
Reporting model is almost identical to the <a href="https://dddsamplenet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=CQRS&referringTitle=CQRS%20-%20Event%20Sourcing&ANCHOR#Reporting">one in CQRS variant</a>.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
