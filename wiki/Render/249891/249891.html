<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Running the demo</h1>
There many different ways to run the DDDSample.Net. Some of them are:
<ol><li>Use binary release &#39;as is&#39;. Just click <a href="http://dddsamplenet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=42247#ReleaseFiles">here</a> to download an installer in <b>msi</b> format. Follow the installation wizard. Unfortunately you have to manually add write access rights for IIS account to App_Data folder in DDDSample&#39;s installation directory. Then open the browser and type configured web address and click &#39;Reset database&#39; to create tables. Your brand new DDDSample installation uses file-based SQLite RDBMS.</li>
<li>Use source code and SQLite. Same as above, but you have to download source code (for example from <a href="http://dddsamplenet.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/42592">here</a>) and run it under VisualStudio.</li>
<li>Use source code and stand-alone RDBMS (like SQL Server 2008). Just uncomment appropriate connection strings and NHibernate configuration options in web.config files. Remember to reset your database before using booking/tracking UI.</li></ol></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
